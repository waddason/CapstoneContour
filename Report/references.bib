@article{PIZARRO2022104348,
  abstract = {Due to recent advances in machine learning, there has been an explosive development of multiple methodologies that automatically extract information from architectural floor plans. Nevertheless, the lack of a standard notation and the high variability in style and composition make it urgent to devise reliable and effective approaches to analyze and recognize objects like walls, doors, and rooms from rasterized images. For such reason, and with the aim of bringing some significant contribution to the state-of-the-art, this paper provides a critical revision of the methodologies and tools from rule-based and learning-based approaches between the years 1995 to 2021. Datasets, scopes, and algorithms were discussed to guide future developers to improve productivity and reduce costs in the construction and design industries. This study concludes that most research relies on a particular plan style, facing problems regarding generalization and comparison due to the lack of a standard metric and the limited public datasets. However, the study also highlights that combining existing tasks can be employed in various and increasing applications.},

  abstract       = {This paper presents a new framework to classify floor plan elements and represent them in a vector format. Unlike existing approaches using image-based learning frameworks as the first step to segment the image pixels, we first convert the input floor plan image into vector data and utilize a graph neural network. Our framework consists of three steps. (1) image pre-processing and vectorization of the floor plan image; (2) region adjacency graph conversion; and (3) the graph neural network on converted floor plan graphs. Our approach is able to capture different types of indoor elements including basic elements, such as walls, doors, and symbols, as well as spatial elements, such as rooms and corridors. In addition, the proposed method can also detect element shapes. Experimental results show that our framework can classify indoor elements with an F1 score of 95%, with scale and rotation invariance. Furthermore, we propose a new graph neural network model that takes the distance between nodes into account, which is a valuable feature of spatial network data.},

  abstract= {A generic method for floor plan analysis and interpretation is presented in this article. The method, which is mainly inspired by the way engineers draw and interpret floor plans, applies two recognition steps in a bottom-up manner. First, basic building blocks, i.e., walls, doors, and windows are detected using a statistical patch-based segmentation approach. Second, a graph is generated, and structural pattern recognition techniques are applied to further locate the main entities, i.e., rooms of the building. The proposed approach is able to analyze any type of floor plan regardless of the notation used. We have evaluated our method on different publicly available datasets of real architectural floor plans with different notations. The overall detection and recognition accuracy is about 95%, which is significantly better than any other state-of-the-art method. Our approach is generic enough such that it could be easily adopted to the recognition and interpretation of any other printed machine-generated structured documents.},
